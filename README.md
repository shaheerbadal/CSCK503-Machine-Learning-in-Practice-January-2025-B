# Developing Machine Learning Models for Predicting Atmospheric Emissions
### Scenario:
You have been engaged as a contract data scientist by Athana Data Science Services (ADSS), a small company specialising in the provision of data science consultancy services to public and private sector organisations. ADSS have just been awarded a contract by a government department (the Department of Environment) to help with the development of machine learning-based models for predicting atmospheric emissions (and pollution) from data gathered by various borough and county environment monitoring units. Your team leader wants you to assist with this project, and you will be required to carry out a number of tasks using the Anaconda/Scikit-Learn Python ML framework and its components.

### Datasets to be utilized for developing the ML models
Access the following URL:

https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/london-atmospheric-emissions-inventory--laei--2019

The web page describes the various types of data held for monitored atmospheric emissions for the year 2019. Note that ADSS will ultimately be working on datasets compiled over a 50-year period, but you will be focusing only on a single year (2019), in the first instance, when developing the ML models.

### To complete this group project:
Carry out the following tasks

- Identify and describe in some detail at least 3 machine learning algorithms/techniques that you intend to use in your project.  Provide your reasons for selecting those ML methods.
- Specify the types of predictive insights you expect to glean from the data after you have applied your ML models. Your response should be based on actual inspection of the datasets and should be as specific as possible.
- Develop the respective ML models using your Jupyter notebook and Anaconda/Scikit-Learn toolkit to work on the datasets available on the website.
- Assess the performance of each model using suitable ML metrics and explain in detail any differences in model performance.
- Write a report, intended for interested stakeholders, that summarizes the work carried out for tasks 1 â€“ 4, and which presents salient ML modelling results obtained by your group.
